🏦 OOPS Banking System (Python)
📚 Project Overview

This is a console-based Banking System implemented in Python, following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
It simulates basic banking operations: creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, and checking account balances — all via a simple command-line interface.

The project demonstrates your understanding of classes, objects, encapsulation, methods, and modular code structure.
